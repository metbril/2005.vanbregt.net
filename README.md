# 2005.vanbregt.net

My personal website around the year 2005.

I had not archived or preserved this site in any other way, but fortunately [The Wayback Machine][machine] had me covered.

I used the [Wayback Machine Downloader][downloader] gem to download the entire site, did some manual fixes and uploaded the HTML files to GitHub. They are currently served at https://2005.vanbregt.eu/.
